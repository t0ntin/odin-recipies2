    <h2>The one that makes you think of home!</h2>
    <p>A hearty vegetarian lentil stew that's delicious, inexpensive, and goes a long way. Even if you're not a vegetarian, it makes a fulfilling, delicious meal. A nice crusty bread goes well on the side. Great to bring to work. This is a bulk recipe that keeps well refrigerated and reheats very nicely. Don't be afraid to scale down if need be.</p>
